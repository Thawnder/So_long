# so_long (125/100)

**so_long** is a project at 42 School that involves creating a simple 2D game using the MiniLibX graphics library. The base goal is to build a game where a player navigates through a map, collects items, and reaches the exit. Having done bonuses, you have to do so while also avoiding enemies that move randomly.
## Features
- Custom implementation of a 2D game engine.
- Supports player movement with arrow keys, item collection, and map rendering.
- Integration with the MiniLibX graphics library for real-time rendering.
- Animated sprites for the character and enemies. (bonus)
- Live move counter. (bonus)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   <pre>
   git clone https://github.com/Thawnder/so_long.git
   </pre>
2. Compile the so_long program:
   <pre>
   make
   </pre>
3. Run the so_long program with a map file as an argument:
   <pre>
   ./so_long maps/map.ber
   </pre>
   Replace `maps/map.ber` with the path to the map file you want to use.
